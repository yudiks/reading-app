    "When the Community Center opened its Summer Explorers Club, Coach Li surprised everyone with a challenge. \"Tomorrow we will hunt digital creatures,\" she announced, holding up her phone. \"We will use Pokémon GO to explore the neighborhood and learn how augmented reality mixes the real world with the screen.\"",
    "The next morning, Sofia, Jamal, and Priya gathered at Riverside Park. Coach Li explained that the app uses GPS to place virtual Pokémon on real maps. By turning on the camera, players see animations layered over sidewalks, gardens, and benches.",
    "They practiced catching a friendly Bulbasaur that popped up near the fountain. Priya swiped the screen to toss a virtual Poké Ball while Jamal reminded her to crouch so the picture looked like the creature was sitting on the steps. Sofia noted how the app resized the Pokémon as she moved closer or farther away.",
    "Coach Li handed each team a neighborhood map labeled with PokéStops—special locations where players collect items. The club visited a mural, a library statue, and a community garden. At every stop they paused to read the plaques, adding new facts to their journal. Pokémon GO encouraged them to notice art and history they usually hurried past.",
    "After lunch, the club battled a large Raid Boss together. The game required teamwork: Jamal timed his strongest attacks, Sofia cheered when everyone dodged in sync, and Priya used healing potions to keep their creatures energized. They high-fived when the Pokémon finally joined their collection.",
    "Back at the Community Center, Coach Li led a safety talk. The club listed smart rules such as staying with a buddy, watching for traffic, and respecting private property. They also agreed not to spoof locations or post photos of strangers without permission. Augmented reality was exciting, but responsibility came first.",
    "To wrap up the week, the Explorers designed their own augmented reality ideas. Jamal imagined a pollinator quest that rewards players for spotting bees and butterflies. Priya sketched a history hunt where statues tell stories. Sofia created a math trail that reveals puzzles when players scan murals."
