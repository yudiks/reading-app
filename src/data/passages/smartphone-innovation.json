    "When Ms. Lane rolled a cart of gadgets into the Innovation Lab, her students leaned over the table. She lined up a flip phone from 2005, a digital camera, an MP3 music player, and finally a shiny smartphone. \"Each device does a job,\" she said, \"but the smartphone combines them all. Let's explore how that happened.\"",
    "She passed around the older devices first. Mateo snapped a photo with the camera and discovered it only stored twenty pictures. The MP3 player needed a computer to sync songs. Before smartphones, people carried several gadgets to capture memories, call friends, and listen to music.",
    "Next Ms. Lane projected a timeline. Engineers had been shrinking computer chips for decades, making them faster while using less power. She explained how touch screens replaced buttons and how early smartphones opened websites like mini desktops.",
    "The class opened a smartphone to see the hidden parts. Inside they found a battery the size of a deck of cards, camera lenses thinner than pencils, and sensors that feel motion, light, and even how close your face is to the screen.",
    "Ms. Lane handed out a chart of popular apps. She pointed out how software turns phones into translators, drawing pads, flashlights, or video studios. Riley shared that her aunt uses a screen reader app to hear messages, while Amir uses a navigation app to find bike routes. Smartphones keep changing because coders design new apps every day.",
    "Before class ended, the students debated responsibilities that come with pocket computers. They listed ways to protect privacy, store strong passwords, and ask before posting photos. Mateo suggested setting a daily screen timer so he still plays soccer outside.",
    "As the bell rang, Ms. Lane reminded them that future innovations might include flexible screens or solar charging cases. She challenged the class to sketch their own ideas for an accessory that solves a real problem. The students packed up with buzzing imaginations, ready to design the next upgrade in pocket technology."
