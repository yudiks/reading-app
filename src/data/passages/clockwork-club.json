    "Jasper pressed his palm against the chilly brass gears stacked on the attic table. The town square clock had been stuck at three o'clock for days, and the mayor begged the Clockwork Club to restore it before the Winter Lights Festival. Blueprints, cocoa mugs, and tool kits surrounded the friends like a campsite.",
    "Lina unrolled her Troubleshooting Timeline and clipped on a headlamp. Noor sorted bolts by size while Jasper inspected a gear’s teeth against the window glow. Their advisor, Mr. Calder, rolled in a cart of tools and tapped a tuning fork. \"A clock listens to rhythm,\" he reminded them. \"Match the beat, and it will move again.\"",
    "They climbed the spiral stairs into the tower’s dusty belly. Feathers were tangled around the pendulum, and a frayed cord dangled from its pulley. Jasper swapped in the braided rope they had braided from climbing line, Noor brushed debris away, and Lina tightened loosened screws until each one squeaked snugly into place.",
    "When Jasper polished the pendulum bob, faint letters shimmered: \"Time rewards the patient builder.\" The message turned into their motto. Lina slowed her checklist, Noor logged every adjustment, and Jasper counted gently while they tested the swing. Numbers finally stayed steady in the margins of the blueprint.",
    "Near dawn, Mr. Calder handed around cinnamon rolls and suggested a final test. The friends huddled on the roof as pink light touched the clock face. A soft click whispered from the gears, followed by the confident bong of the bell rolling across the sleepy square. Lights blinked on in nearby windows as neighbors cheered.",
    "Back in the attic, Lina taped the hidden message into their logbook, Jasper wrote notes about steady breathing on ladders, and Noor sketched ideas for mentoring younger builders. By festival night the clock chimed every hour, and the club knew the message was meant for the whole town: patience, courage, and teamwork keep time turning."
