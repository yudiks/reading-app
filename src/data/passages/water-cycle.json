    "Picture a single raindrop landing on your window and then imagine it starting an adventurous journey. Scientists call that journey the water cycle, a repeating pattern that keeps water moving on, above, and below Earth.",
    "The trip begins when the sun shines on lakes, oceans, and even tiny puddles. Sunlight warms the surface and gives energy to the water molecules, helping them slip away into the air as a gas called water vapor. This warming-and-lifting step is called evaporation, and it happens even when you cannot see it.",
    "High above the ground the air feels cooler. As vapor rises, it bumps into chillier temperatures and tiny bits of dust floating in the sky. The vapor changes back into liquid droplets that cling together to make clouds, a process scientists label condensation. Wispy cirrus clouds or puffy cumulus towers are both built from countless condensed droplets.",
    "Clouds cannot grow forever. When droplets combine and become heavy, gravity tugs on them and they tumble back toward Earth. If the air is warm, the droplets fall as rain. When the air is icy, the water forms snowflakes or hard hailstones. No matter the shape, falling water is called precipitation.",
    "The story continues on the ground. Some precipitation splashes into streams and rivers that rush downhill toward wider lakes and salty oceans. Some soaks into the soil, sliding between grains of sand and tiny cracks in rock until it reaches underground pools called aquifers. Trees and wildflowers sip that groundwater to stay healthy.",
    "Plants return part of that borrowed water to the air through a process named transpiration; leaves act like small pumps sending vapor skyward. Animals also move water when they drink from ponds, splash in mud, or breathe out mist on a chilly morning, proving the cycle involves every creature on Earth.",
    "Eventually, all the wandering water gathers again in oceans, lakes, glaciers, or deep underground basins. From there the sun will heat it once more, starting another round of evaporation. Because each stage feeds the next, the water cycle never takes a vacation, ensuring our planet stays watered, balanced, and full of life."
