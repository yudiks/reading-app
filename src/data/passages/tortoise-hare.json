    "Every spring the forest held a grand race, and this year the clearing buzzed with excited chatter. Bluebirds fluttered above the starting line while chipmunks painted lane markers in the dirt. The hare bounced from paw to paw, boasting that his legs were blurs of lightning and that the tortoise would only see drifting dust.",
    "The tortoise ignored the teasing and rolled his shoulders like a practiced athlete. He greeted each spectator by name, reminding them that he trained by trekking over pebbles and roots every morning. \"I may be slow,\" he said calmly, \"but I never give up, and I always finish what I start.\" His voice sounded like a drumbeat that promised steady courage.",
    "At the whistle, the hare blasted forward, ears streaming behind him. He zigzagged between maple trunks, showing off with leaps so high the crowd gasped. When he glanced back, the tortoise was only a green speck near the starting banner, so the hare laughed and cried, \"Easy victory!\" He dashed ahead to impress his cheering forest fans everywhere.",
    "After a few minutes the hare grew bored with running alone. He practiced cartwheels, admired his reflection in the river, and boasted about his unbeatable speed. Feeling drowsy, he stretched out beneath a shady tree and promised himself he would nap for just five minutes.",
    "Meanwhile the tortoise kept a careful rhythmâ€”left foot, right foot, breathe, repeat. He noticed sunlight sparkling on the path and heard frogs croaking encouragement from the marsh. Squirrels waved leafy flags while owls hooted a countdown that kept him focused. When he reached the resting tree, he softened his steps so he would not wake the snoring hare and continued onward, determined not to waste a single second.",
    "The crowd erupted when the tortoise appeared at the final bend, eyes focused straight ahead. He crossed the finish rope to a roar of applause, just as the hare jolted awake and sprinted forward in a panic. \"How did I lose?\" the hare cried, ears drooping with surprise. The tortoise smiled and replied, \"Fast feet are nice, but steady steps win the race.\""
