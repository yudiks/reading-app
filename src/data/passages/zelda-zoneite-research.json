    "The Depths pulsed with teal light as Zelda set up a research tent beside a massive Zonaite vein. Robbie wheeled in a cart stacked with Purah Pad sensors, while Josha unrolled a notebook labeled Energy Study #12. They wanted to understand why Zonaite cells store so much power for Link's vehicles.",
    "Zelda sliced a thin Zonaite wafer and placed it between two metal plates. When she pressed the plates together, a current meter lit up. Zelda explained that Zonaite crystals have layers of mineralsâ€”some layers let electrons move, while others block them like gates. Squeezing the crystal nudged electrons through the gateway, creating electricity.",
    "Robbie built a miniature battery using three crystal slices stacked in a tube. He charged it with a Zonai charge orb, then connected it to a light. The glow lasted twice as long as a normal Hylian battery. Josha recorded the data and noticed that cooler temperatures made the light shine even longer. Cold underground air slowed the electrons just enough to prevent wasted heat.",
    "To test durability, the team placed a battery on a rock platform attached to Zonai springs. Robbie launched it upward like a pogo stick. The springs shook the battery, but the light stayed steady. Zonaite's layered structure absorbed vibrations, proving why Link's machines survive rough landings.",
    "Next, Zelda compared energy flow above ground. She carried a charged cell to Lookout Landing and placed it inside a cooking pot warmer. Using Purah Pad graphs, she discovered that daylight caused a tiny boost in voltage. Sunlight heated the outer layer of the crystal, letting electrons move more freely.",
    "Back in the Depths, the trio built a safety poster for explorers. It reminded them to store cells in padded boxes, keep them dry, and let used batteries cool before recharging. Zelda added a final note: sharing data keeps Hyrule safe. Their study traveled to every research base, helping engineers design sturdier wings, carts, and lamps for the journey through Tears of the Kingdom."
