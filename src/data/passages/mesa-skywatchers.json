    "Dawn painted Painted Mesa in bands of peach and copper as Tala followed her grandma, Abuela Sky, up the sandstone trail. Abuela balanced notebooks and a solar compass, guiding visitors through the history of ancestral Pueblo skywatchers. Tala carried colored pencils to sketch clues they uncovered together.",
    "At the mesa top Abuela pointed to a ring of basalt stones hugging a carved spiral. A slim pillar in the center threw a pencil-thin shadow across the design. \"This is a solar marker,\" Abuela explained. \"On the summer solstice the shadow touches this edge. On the winter solstice it slides to the opposite notch.\" Tala traced both marks and pictured farmers timing their planting by the dancing shadow.",
    "They stepped into a cliff dwelling tucked like a swallowâ€™s nest under the rock. Murals in clay reds and blues curled across the walls, and beside a window stretched a ladder of star shapes. Abuela said the ladder recorded bright Venus as it rose before dawn to signal gatherings.",
    "A narrow ledge held small peep holes cut through stone. When certain stars rose or when the moon crowned the sky, beams of light slipped through the openings and painted glowing dots on the back wall.",
    "Later Abuela passed Tala a round mirror called a heliograph. Tala flashed sunlight toward another guide across the canyon and saw two answering blinks wink back. \"Light can carry messages faster than footsteps,\" Abuela said. \"Fire, mirrors, and shiny mica flakes once linked mesas like a web of stars.\"",
    "That night the desert cooled quickly, so they unrolled sleeping pads on the mesa rim. Abuela set up a small telescope while Tala arranged her pencils like tiny rockets. They watched Venus shimmer, Orion climb, and a meteor streak overhead. Wrapped in a blanket stitched with corn and constellations, Tala listened as Abuela whispered, \"The sky is a library that never closes. When we take notes and share them, we honor the builders of these stone calendars.\" By dawn her notebook brimmed with labeled sketches and questions for classmates about how skywatchers linked science, art, and community."
