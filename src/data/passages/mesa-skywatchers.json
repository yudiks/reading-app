    "The first time Tala climbed Painted Mesa, dawn painted the sandstone walls in bands of peach and copper. Her grandma, who everyone called Abuela Sky, balanced notebooks and a small solar compass. Abuela was a museum guide who studied how ancestral Pueblo people watched the sky to plan harvests and ceremonies. Tala carried colored pencils so she could sketch everything they discovered.",
    "At the top of the mesa, Abuela pointed to a circle of basalt stones. In the center stood a narrow rock pillar that cast a long shadow across the ground. \"This is a solar marker,\" Abuela explained. \"On the summer solstice the shadow reaches the very edge of that carved spiral. On the winter solstice it points to the opposite notch.\" Tala traced the spiral with her pencil.",
    "They hiked to a cliff dwelling tucked into the rock like a swallow's nest. Murals swirled across the walls in earthy reds and soft blues. Tala spotted a ladder of star shapes beside a window. Abuela explained that the ladder recorded the path of bright Venus as it rose before dawn and after sunset.",
    "Abuela led Tala to a narrow ledge shaded by overhanging stone. The ledge faced the valley where cornfields once rippled in summer wind. \"Notice these peep holes,\" Abuela said. Small openings in the wall framed the horizon. When certain stars rose or when the moon reached its highest point, beams of light slid through the holes and painted the inside wall.",
    "As the sun climbed, Abuela handed Tala a small mirror. They called the round tool a heliograph. Tala flashed reflected light toward another guide across the canyon, who answered with two bright flashes. \"Light can carry messages faster than footsteps,\" Abuela said. \"The ancients used fire, mirrors, and shiny mica flakes to send news between mesas.\"",
    "After lunch, Tala opened Abuela's oldest notebook. Inside were careful sketches of stone alignments, along with weather notes about drought years and rainy seasons. Tala noticed that each page included a story from a community elder explaining how sky knowledge shaped kindness on the ground.",
    "When the desert cooled, they unrolled sleeping pads on the mesa top. Abuela set up a small telescope while Tala arranged her colored pencils like tiny rockets. They watched Venus glow near the horizon and waited for the constellation Orion to climb. Abuela whispered how ancient storytellers described Orion as a hunter who shared his fire with travelers.",
    "Just before midnight, a meteor streaked across the sky. Tala gasped so loudly that coyotes yipped in reply. Abuela wrapped Tala in a blanket decorated with corn and starlight patterns. \"Remember,\" Abuela said, \"the sky is a library that never closes. When we observe carefully and compare notes, we honor the people who built these stone calendars and the land that still listens to them.\"",
    "By the time dawn returned, Tala's sketches filled several pages. She labeled each drawing with questions about light, shadow, and tradition. She felt ready to share how skywatchers connected science, art, and community across centuries."
