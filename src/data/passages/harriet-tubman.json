    "Harriet Tubman was born into slavery on a Maryland plantation where long days of chopping wood and lifting traps never seemed to end. Even as a child she held tight to a dream of a life where families could choose their own paths and nobody could be sold away.",
    "When Harriet grew older, she listened closely to whispered maps and hidden songs that pointed the way north. She memorized spirituals whose secret meanings told travelers when it was safe. Conductors on the Underground Railroad described which rivers were shallow enough to cross and which farmhouses offered shelter. One daring night she followed the North Star, crept past patrols, and crossed streams until she reached the free state of Pennsylvania.",
    "Freedom felt wonderful, but Harriet could not forget her parents, sisters, and friends who were still trapped in slavery. She saved money, studied the landscape, and returned south again and again. Moving mostly at night, she guided small groups through pine forests, swamps, and tidal marshes along secret routes people called the Underground Railroad.",
    "Harriet carried a lantern that cut through darkness and a notebook filled with hidden codes. She relied on trusted friends called conductors—people who opened safe houses and whispered the next directions. Sometimes she disguised herself as a fieldworker or an elderly woman, never losing a single traveler on the dangerous trail to freedom.",
    "During the Civil War, Harriet offered her skills to the Union Army. She served as a nurse who brewed herbal medicines, then as a scout who mapped rivers and bridges in the South. In 1863 she helped plan and lead the Combahee River rescue mission, guiding Union boats to plantations and freeing hundreds of people in one night.",
    "After the war, Harriet settled in Auburn, New York, where she planted gardens, opened a boarding house for families starting fresh, and helped build schools for children who had once been denied an education. She also spoke at meetings for women’s voting rights. Her steady courage lit the path toward freedom for countless families and showed that determined leadership can change history."
