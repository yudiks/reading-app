    "On a crisp Saturday morning, Mei zipped her raincoat and joined the River Guardians along the muddy bank of the Silver Fern River. Ms. Rojas passed out waterproof notebooks and said, \"Good scientists begin by noticing,\" so Mei sketched a crawfish between pebbles before dipping a test strip—green for cool temperature, yellow for balanced acidity.",
    "The club hiked upstream through tall ferns. Mei’s friend Davion spotted a fallen log, and together they counted rings on the stump—sixty-seven winters recorded in tight circles. Mei wrote that old trees act like sponges, slowing storm water before it rushes into the river.",
    "At their first survey stop Ms. Rojas unfurled a laminated map threaded with blue arrows. The Silver Fern River twisted past farms, playgrounds, and the harbor before meeting the sea. \"A watershed is a neighborhood for water,\" she explained as Mei traced the arrows with her finger and imagined a raindrop traveling from hilltop to harbor.",
    "After lunch they followed a feeder creek and gasped at the trash scattered along the path. The club fanned out with mesh bags while Davion logged their haul: eight wrappers, twelve bottle caps, three plastic forks, and one cracked toy arm. Mei wondered how many fish they had protected.",
    "Back at the main river, ranger Mr. Ellis taught them to test dissolved oxygen. When the vial turned sky-blue, he grinned; it meant trout, dragonfly nymphs, and otters could breathe easily. Mei copied the number, knowing healthy water depended on invisible gas as much as on clean banks.",
    "As shadows stretched long, Mei interviewed walkers on the river trail. An artist explained how painting the river each season helped him spot changes, while a baker described composting orange peels so scraps wouldn’t blow into the water. Their stories joined the data in her notebook. Before heading home, each Guardian promised one action for the week; Mei chose to write a school article with graphs from their findings. She watched the river shimmer toward the harbor and believed the club’s motto—Guardians notice, measure, and imagine better futures—moved with the current."
