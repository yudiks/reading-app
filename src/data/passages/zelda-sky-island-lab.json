    "The Sky Islands above Hyrule glowed gold as Zelda and Link rolled open the doors of their new Wind Field Lab. Using Zonaite parts and Purah's guidance, they built a platform filled with spinning anemometers, wind socks, and a device that measured air pressure called a barograph. Their mission: understand the strong gusts that power Zonai gliders.",
    "Link activated a Zonai fan while Zelda read numbers from a tablet. The fan's breeze nudged a glider wing hanging from the ceiling. Zelda noticed that when the wing tilted slightly, the lift numbers climbed. She explained that air moving faster over the curved top of the wing creates lower pressure, helping the glider rise—just like scientists describe with Bernoulli’s principle.",
    "Next, the duo launched a glider off the floating deck. Link steered toward a gust that curled around a tall sky island. Zelda dropped colored leaves that trailed behind him. From the lab, students from Lookout Landing drew the swirling leaf paths on a map. The curves showed where wind deflected around islands, creating invisible ramps that pilots could ride.",
    "At midday, Mineru's Construct delivered crystals that recorded temperature. Zelda placed them along a chain of islands from the sunny top layer to a shaded cavern pocket. Later the crystals reported a ten-degree difference. Warm air rose and flowed toward cooler pockets, producing a steady breeze. Zelda compared the pattern to sea breezes that scientists study near real-world coasts.",
    "To test renewable energy, the team attached Zonai turbines to a rail cart. When Link pushed it downhill, wind turned the blades and charged energy cells. The data showed that even gentle slopes produced enough power to run cooking pots and lights for sky explorers.",
    "That evening, Zelda met the students to turn their findings into a Sky Island Wind Atlas. They marked safe glide lanes, energy-rich gust corridors, and calm zones for camping. Link added a safety note reminding travelers to check wind direction before jumping. Their atlas proved that careful measurements and Hylian curiosity could make every flight across Tears of the Kingdom smarter and safer."
