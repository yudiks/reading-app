    "On the first day of Coding Camp, instructor Nadia wrote one word on the whiteboard: Python. The campers murmured about snakes and then laughed when Nadia held up a plush python wearing headphones. \"This mascot loves music,\" she said. \"By Friday you'll teach it to dance using Python code.\"",
    "Nadia explained that Python is a programming language people use for websites, science experiments, and animation. She showed how the language reads almost like English. On their laptops, campers typed print(\"Hello, Camp!\") and watched the greeting appear instantly.",
    "Each morning began with a mini-lesson. Day one focused on variables, like boxes that store information. Day two introduced loops that repeat instructions. Day three added if-statements that help code make decisions.",
    "After lessons, the campers tackled challenges. For the variable race, teams stored scores for a pretend robotics contest. During the loop relay, they programmed a turtle graphic to draw colorful spirals. Later they used if-statements to build a quiz that replied with encouraging messages when someone guessed incorrectly.",
    "Midweek, Nadia introduced debugging. She intentionally left out parentheses or misspelled words so the code displayed error messages. Campers learned to read the clues, fix one issue at a time, and celebrate when the program finally ran.",
    "On Thursday they visited the community garden to gather data. Using tablets, campers recorded sunlight levels, soil moisture, and plant heights. Back at camp, they fed the numbers into a Python program that calculated average growth for the garden club.",
    "For the final project, each camper designed a mini app for someone in the community. Jayla created a random dance generator for the plush python. Lin coded a reminder tool that texts her grandpa to water tomato plants. Omar built a scoreboard that tracks goals during recess soccer.",
    "At Friday's showcase, families watched demos and read code printed beside each laptop. Nadia praised the campers for thinking like codersâ€”breaking problems into steps, testing ideas, and supporting one another. As the plush python bobbed to Jayla's dance program, the campers cheered, proud that a week of Python practice had turned curiosity into creative power."
