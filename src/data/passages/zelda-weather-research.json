    "Thunder rolled over the Hebra Mountains as Purah calibrated a Skyview balloon tether. Zelda clipped a Silverscale sensor pack to the line and grinned. \"Tears of the Kingdom is full of sudden storms,\" she said. \"Today we'll map lightning so travelers know when to glide and when to shelter.\"",
    "With a whoosh, the balloon lifted, carrying sensors that tracked temperature, humidity, electric charge, and wind speed. Robbie monitored the data on a Purah Pad. When the balloon reached storm clouds, the charge sensor spiked. Robbie noted the altitude and direction, marking a lightning risk zone on Hyrule's map.",
    "Meanwhile, Link glided through a neighboring updraft pillar with a Zonai wing. The Purah Pad showed calm readings there, proving that some sky columns remain safe even during mountain storms. Zelda compared the two sites and realized that lightning clustered near cold, moisture-rich peaks while updrafts above warm plains stayed clear.",
    "To double-check, the team launched a second balloon from the tropical Faron region. The sensor pack measured warm, moist air rising steadily. When rain began, the balloon recorded how humidity climbed before the first drop fell. Zelda turned the data into a rule: if humidity rises faster than temperature, rain will follow within half an hour.",
    "They also collected ground reports. Rito scouts shared how frequently metal arrows hummed before lightning. Gerudo guards measured sand temperature during desert gusts. Combining sky and ground clues let Purah's lab build a forecast chart for each province.",
    "Back at Lookout Landing, Zelda painted the information onto a gigantic Glider Guidance Board. Green skies marked safe soaring, yellow warned of gusty crosswinds, and red streaks meant lightning danger. She added tips such as using wood weapons during storms, wearing rubber armor, and anchoring airships before thunder arrives.",
    "Hyrule's explorers visited the board before each journey. Korok couriers planned delivery routes, and Zonai miners scheduled balloon ascents for calm mornings. By studying weather with balloons, sensors, and community reports, Zelda's team proved that science can help everyone adventure through Tears of the Kingdom with confidence and care."
