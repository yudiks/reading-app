    "Mr. Gomez turned the classroom into a computer history museum. Students entered to find posters of giant machines from the 1940s, a table stacked with floppy disks, and a shelf displaying tablets and slim laptops. \"Today we will learn how computers shrank and grew smarter,\" he said. \"Each group gets a decade to explore.\"",
    "Keisha's group researched ENIAC, one of the first electronic computers. They discovered it filled an entire room, used about 18,000 vacuum tubes, and heated up like a bakery oven. Programmers had to plug cables and flip switches to solve math problems.",
    "Across the room, Omar's team explored the 1980s. They booted up a beige desktop that whirred to life with a blinking green cursor. Omar typed commands into the MS-DOS screen while Mr. Gomez explained that coders wrote instructions in languages like BASIC or C to tell the machine what to do.",
    "Next, Mei's team examined a modern laptop. They pointed out the flat motherboard, tiny solid-state drive, and day-long battery. When they opened a programming environment, Mei wrote a short script that turned words different colors.",
    "To connect the decades, Mr. Gomez drew a timeline on the board. Students added sticky notes describing milestones: microchips replacing vacuum tubes, the invention of the mouse, the rise of the internet, and cloud storage that lets people access files from any device.",
    "In the afternoon, the class interviewed community members via video call. A retired engineer described using punch cards at her first job. A game designer explained how teams still rely on classic coding languages, but now combine them with modern tools like graphic engines and version control.",
    "For homework, everyone created a mini exhibit card. They listed three facts about their decade, sketched the computer they studied, and wrote one question for future inventors. Keisha wondered how quantum computers might change medicine. Omar dreamed about keyboards that project onto desks. Mei hoped laptops would charge with clean energy."
