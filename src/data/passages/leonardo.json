    "Leonardo da Vinci grew up in Italy more than 500 years ago, wandering the hills near his village of Vinci. He watched birds banking on the wind, studied ripples in the Arno River, and filled scraps of paper with quick sketches so he would not forget a single detail.",
    "As a teenager Leonardo traveled to Florence to train in an artist’s workshop. There he learned how to mix pigments, stretch canvases, and sculpt marble. When he painted portraits like the Mona Lisa, he studied microscopic changes in a smile and how light dances across cheekbones, making his artwork seem to breathe. He arranged figures in murals like The Last Supper so every gesture told a story.",
    "Leonardo kept notebooks tucked under his arm wherever he went. In them he scribbled questions, mirror-writing them backward like a private code only he could read easily. Pages spilled over with maps, riddles, and lists of experiments he hoped to try the next day.",
    "His curiosity didn’t stop with paint. Leonardo designed flying machines with whirling wings, sketched bridges that could fold in moments, and even imagined a leather diving suit so explorers could study underwater life. Some inventions were models for celebrations, while others were clever machines intended to protect cities during war.",
    "He studied music and mathematics alongside nature. Leonardo measured how fast the Arno River flowed, recorded weather patterns, and copied the spiral of a seashell or the branching of a tree, convinced that art and science spoke the same language.",
    "Night after night he visited hospitals to learn how the human body works. With permission from doctors, he carefully drew muscles, bones, and hearts, labeling each tendon and chamber so he could understand how people move, breathe, and heal. His drawings looked like works of art and science combined.",
    "Leonardo’s notebooks stretch across art, engineering, music, and nature studies. They show that a curious mind can connect everything at once, turning questions into paintings, inventions, and discoveries that still inspire engineers, artists, and dreamers today."
