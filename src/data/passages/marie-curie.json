    "Marie Curie, born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland, loved solving puzzles more than anything. She memorized constellations, practiced math riddles with her father, and spent rainy afternoons taking apart clocks just to see how the gears fit together again.",
    "In Poland the government closed advanced schools to girls, so Maria joined a secret evening class where teachers risked arrest to share science. To earn money for train fare to Paris, she worked as a tutor and saved every coin.",
    "Paris was cold and crowded, yet thrilling. Maria—who now called herself Marie—studied at the Sorbonne, attending chemistry and physics lectures by day and copying notes late into the night until she ranked first in her class.",
    "In a lab full of dusty instruments, Marie met another curious scientist named Pierre Curie. They married and became partners who tested crystals and mysterious minerals that glowed faintly in the dark. Marie wondered if the glow meant the atoms inside those rocks were releasing invisible energy.",
    "To find out, Marie crushed tons of a heavy ore called pitchblende, stirring boiling pots for hours and separating one grain at a time. Her experiments proved the rocks gave off their own energy, so she named the phenomenon radioactivity and discovered two new elements: polonium, honoring her homeland, and radium, which shone with a pale blue light.",
    "The Curies' discoveries changed medicine and science. Laboratories used radium to study atoms, and doctors learned to aim the energy at tumors. Marie became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and later earned a second for her ongoing experiments.",
    "When World War I erupted, Marie refused to leave her knowledge in the laboratory. She designed small X-ray vehicles nicknamed \"Little Curies\" and trained nurses to drive them. Rolling over muddy roads, she used the machines to spot broken bones so surgeons could help soldiers faster.",
    "After the war, Marie opened research institutes in Paris and Warsaw and offered scholarships to young scientists who lacked money, just as she once had. Her story shows that brave questions, steady effort, and a generous heart can brighten the world for everyone."
