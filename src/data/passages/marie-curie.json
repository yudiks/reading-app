    "Marie Curie, born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland, loved solving puzzles more than anything. When she was ten, she spent rainy afternoons taking apart clocks just to see how they worked.",
    "At that time, women were not allowed to attend science classes in many parts of Europe. Marie refused to let that stop her. She saved money, moved to Paris, and enrolled at a famous school called the Sorbonne.",
    "Marie studied how certain rocks gave off energy even in the dark. She named this energy radioactivity. Working side by side with her husband Pierre, Marie discovered two new elements, polonium and radium.",
    "Her careful experiments helped doctors use X-rays to see broken bones. During World War I, Marie even drove a special van that carried X-ray machines to help injured soldiers.",
    "Marie Curie's passion for science earned her two Nobel Prizes. Her story teaches us that brave questions can brighten the world."
