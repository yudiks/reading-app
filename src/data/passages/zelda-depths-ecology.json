    "Deep beneath Hyrule, Zelda and a team of sages floated across a gloom river in a lightboat. The floor sparkled with bright blue luminous stones. Riju steadied a crate of sample jars while Yunobo carried heat-resistant shovels. They were mapping bioluminescenceâ€”the way plants and creatures glow in the dark Depths.",
    "Their first stop was a grove of Brightbloom plants. Zelda measured how much light each bloom produced using a crystal photometer. She discovered that larger blooms shone brighter when they soaked up sunlight near surface entrances. Plants that grew in shadow emitted softer glows, suggesting that sunlight helps them restock glowing minerals.",
    "Next, Sidon collected water from a luminous pond. Tiny plankton twinkled when he stirred the surface. Sidon gently bubbled air through a funnel, and the plankton flashed brighter. Zelda explained that many glowing creatures react to motion, using light bursts to scare away predators.",
    "Yunobo scanned Rocklike dens with a temperature wand. Some dens glowed green, others gold. The wand showed that hotter rocks glowed stronger. Zelda noted that minerals like Topaz stored heat and released it as light. Recording temperatures helped them predict where gloom hazards might hide.",
    "To test how explorers could use the glows, Riju set up three camp areas: one lit by Brightblooms, one by bottled pond plankton, and one by Zonaite lamps. Hyrule field medics read a medical guide at each camp. They reported that Brightblooms gave steady light for reading, plankton flickered too much, and lamps worked best for long surgeries.",
    "The team also tracked wildlife. A Dondons herd wore reflective tags that redirected Brightbloom light along paths, creating glowing highways. When a Staldra skeleton approached, the herd shifted so their reflections dazzled it, buying time for Link to shield bash the danger away.",
    "After a week underground, Zelda compiled the survey in Purah's archive. The report highlighted how bioluminescent plants need sunlight reserves, how water life flashes when disturbed, and how explorers can use gentle light to stay safe without attracting monsters. The findings turned the mysterious Depths of Tears of the Kingdom into a mapped ecosystem full of glowing clues."
