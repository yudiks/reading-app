    "Katherine Johnson grew up in the green hills of West Virginia surrounded by brothers and sisters who loved to count everything. She tallied steps on the porch, trees lining the road, and bright stars in the night sky, turning walks into math adventures.",
    "Her hometown school ended at eighth grade, yet Katherine’s teachers saw she needed tougher challenges. They arranged for her to attend a high school on a college campus, and she skipped several grades to start there at ten years old. She devoured geometry and algebra.",
    "College came next at West Virginia State, where professors handed Katherine extra problems because she solved every assignment too quickly. She graduated with honors and later became one of the first Black women invited to attend graduate math classes at West Virginia University, even while segregation tried to block her path.",
    "Katherine loved teaching, but she wanted her calculations to fly. She joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, or NACA, as a \"human computer.\" A sign on the door declared the office \"Colored Computers,\" reminding her that the workplace was segregated. Katherine still filled her notebooks with streamlines, wind-tunnel data, and equations for turning speeds that made airplanes safer.",
    "When the Space Race began, engineers needed someone who could weave numbers into reliable directions through the sky. Katherine calculated trajectories—mathematical road maps—for new rockets. In 1962 astronaut John Glenn refused to launch until Katherine double-checked the electronic computer's answers. Only after she confirmed the orbit did he agree to ride the capsule around Earth.",
    "Later, Katherine joined the team planning Apollo 11's journey to the Moon. She mapped when to fire rockets, where the spacecraft should swing around the Moon, and how to guide the astronauts home through Earth’s atmosphere. Her precise work let the crew plant a flag and splash down safely in the Pacific Ocean.",
    "Katherine Johnson kept working for NASA for more than three decades, writing reports future scientists still read. She earned presidential medals and heard schoolchildren chant her name. Her story shows that curiosity, courage, and a pencil can carry a nation far beyond the horizon."
