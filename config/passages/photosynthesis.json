    "When you step outside on a sunny morning, plants are already hard at work. Leaves use sunlight, water, and air to make food in a process called photosynthesis.",
    "Tiny parts inside the leaf called chloroplasts act like mini kitchens. They catch sunlight with a green helper named chlorophyll.",
    "The leaf mixes sunlight with water from the roots and carbon dioxide from the air. The result is sugar for the plant and oxygen for us to breathe.",
    "Some of the sugar is stored in roots like carrots. Other sugar feeds flowers, fruits, and seeds.",
    "Photosynthesis shows how plants and people share the planet. Without leafy kitchens, Earth would not be full of fresh air, crunchy snacks, and colorful gardens."
