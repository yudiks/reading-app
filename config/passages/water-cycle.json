    "Have you ever wondered where a raindrop travels? The water cycle is a pattern that moves water on, above, and below Earth.",
    "The sun warms lakes and oceans, turning water into vapor. This step is called evaporation.",
    "The vapor floats up and cools. Tiny droplets form clouds in a step named condensation.",
    "When clouds grow heavy, water falls as rain, snow, or hail. This is precipitation.",
    "Some water runs into rivers. Some sinks underground to feed plants. Eventually it returns to lakes or oceans, and the cycle starts again."
